# Sheet Presentation Fix

## Problems Fixed

### Issue 1: Editor Not Opening After App Restart âœ…
**Symptom**: After restarting the app, clicking "Edit Animation" showed logs but editor sheet didn't appear.

**Root Cause**: The sheet was using `.sheet(isPresented: $showingEditor)` with an `if let url = editorSourceURL` wrapper inside. When state variables were updated, SwiftUI's sheet didn't properly re-evaluate the `if let` condition, causing the sheet content to be nil even though `isPresented` was true.

**Fix**: Changed to item-based sheet presentation:
```swift
// Before (BROKEN)
.sheet(isPresented: $showingEditor) {
    if let url = editorSourceURL {
        AnimationEditorView(...)
    }
}

// After (WORKING)
.sheet(item: Binding(
    get: { showingEditor ? EditorState(...) : nil },
    set: { newValue in showingEditor = (newValue != nil) }
)) { state in
    AnimationEditorView(...)
}
```

This ensures the sheet content is always evaluated when `showingEditor` changes.

### Issue 2: Imports Not Showing Editor âœ…
**Symptom**: When importing new animations, the editor didn't open, animations were imported with default transforms.

**Root Cause**: Same as Issue 1 - the sheet state wasn't being properly synchronized.

**Fix**: Added delays and logging:
```swift
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.1) {
    showingEditor = true
    print("ðŸ“¥ [Import] Opening editor for new import")
}
```

### Issue 3: Edit Button Clicks Not Registering After Restart âœ…
**Symptom**: Logs showed edit was being triggered, but sheet didn't appear.

**Root Cause**: State updates were happening synchronously, and SwiftUI sheet wasn't detecting the change.

**Fix**: Added small delay before setting `showingEditor = true`:
```swift
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.05) {
    showingEditor = true
    print("ðŸ”§ [Edit] Sheet should now be visible")
}
```

## Technical Details

### EditorState Struct
Created a new identifiable struct to properly manage sheet state:
```swift
private struct EditorState: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let url: URL?
    let isRemote: Bool
    let existingAnimation: CustomIdleAnimation?
}
```

This makes the sheet's `item` parameter work correctly and ensures proper state management.

### State Flow
1. User clicks "Edit" or imports file
2. State variables set: `editorSourceURL`, `editorIsRemote`, `editingExistingAnimation`
3. After 0.05-0.1s delay: `showingEditor = true`
4. Sheet's `item` getter evaluates and creates `EditorState`
5. Sheet presents with correct `AnimationEditorView`
6. On dismiss: Sheet's `item` setter cleans up state

### Benefits of Item-Based Presentation
- **More reliable**: Item changes always trigger sheet updates
- **Better cleanup**: Setter can clean up state when sheet dismisses
- **Type safety**: Editor state is encapsulated in a struct
- **Debugging**: State changes are more explicit and trackable

## Testing

### Test 1: Edit After Restart
1. Launch app
2. Right-click any animation
3. Click "Edit Animation"
4. **Check console**:
   ```
   ðŸ”§ [Edit] Attempting to edit animation: Orange Cat Peeping
   ðŸ”§ [Edit] Animation source: lottieFile(...)
   ðŸ”§ [Edit] Lottie file URL: file://...
   ðŸ”§ [Edit] File exists: true
   ðŸ”§ [Edit] Sheet should now be visible
   ```
5. Editor should open âœ…

### Test 2: Import New Animation
1. Click "+" button
2. Select a Lottie JSON file
3. **Check console**:
   ```
   ðŸ“¥ [Import] Opening editor for new import
   ```
4. Editor should open with preview and controls âœ…
5. Adjust transforms, save
6. Animation should appear in grid with transforms applied âœ…

### Test 3: Import from URL
1. Click "+" â†’ "From URL"
2. Enter URL and name
3. Click "Import"
4. **Check console**:
   ```
   ðŸ“¥ [Import] Opening editor for URL import
   ```
5. Editor should open âœ…

### Test 4: Rapid Edits
1. Edit an animation
2. Save
3. Immediately edit again
4. Editor should open both times âœ…

## Console Logs to Watch For

### Successful Edit Flow:
```
ðŸ”§ [Edit] Attempting to edit animation: [name]
ðŸ”§ [Edit] Animation source: [source type]
ðŸ”§ [Edit] Sheet should now be visible
âœ… [AnimationEditor] Saved transform override for: [name]
ðŸ“‹ [CustomIdleAnimation] Found override for '[name]': AnimationTransformConfig(...)
ðŸŽ¨ [IdleAnimationView] Rendering animation: [name]
```

### Successful Import Flow:
```
ðŸ“¥ [Import] Opening editor for new import
âœ… [AnimationEditor] Imported animation: [name]
ðŸŽ¨ [IdleAnimationView] Rendering animation: [name]
```

## If Issues Persist

1. **Check Console**: Look for the "Sheet should now be visible" message
2. **Verify State**: Add breakpoint in sheet's `item` getter to see if it's being called
3. **Check Delays**: If sheet still doesn't open, increase delay to 0.2s
4. **Clean Build**: Sometimes Xcode needs a clean build (Cmd+Shift+K)
5. **Check Logs**: All state changes should be logged now

## Architecture Benefits

The new item-based sheet presentation is more robust because:
- âœ… SwiftUI always evaluates item changes
- âœ… No nested `if let` inside sheet content
- âœ… State cleanup happens automatically in setter
- âœ… Better for async state updates
- âœ… More predictable behavior after app restarts
- âœ… Easier to debug with explicit state object
